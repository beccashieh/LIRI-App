# LIRI-App

LIRI is a language recognition app that operates from the command line. It takes in a command and an optional search parameter to return data utilizing the spotify, bands in town, and OMBD apis. 

## Getting Started

From the command line, type node liri.js followed by one of the following commands:
* _**spotify-this-song**_
* _**concert-this**_
* _**movie-this**_
* _**do-what-it-says**_

* After the spotify command, type the name of a song using " ", and the app will return data on the selected song. 
* After the concert command, type the name of an artist using " ", and the app will return data on concert dates for that artist.
* After the movie command, type the name of a movie using " ", and the app will return data on that movie.
* The last command above uses fs to read text entered on the random.txt file and will return spotify data for "I Want it That Way".

### Prerequisites

If you would like to run this program on your own machine, you will need to supply your own .env file containing your spotify ID and secret key.
